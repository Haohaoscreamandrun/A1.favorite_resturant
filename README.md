# Restaurant Search Web Application
##### This is a web application that allows users to search for restaurants by name or category. The application provides details such as address, phone number, and other relevant information about the restaurant. This project is based on one of the projects in AlphaCamp's 2-3 back-end development boot camp.

## Why the project is useful
